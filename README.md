# GE2_InterStellarAssignment
A remake of the interstellar docking scene

## Plan:
Wanted to make the Docking scene from interstellar

## Features I want:
- Pathing 
- Accurate angles to scene
- two objects connecting and matching rotation
- wanted to keep the dialogue of the scene and recreate it with accurate models of characters

## Progress:
- Created the base project.
- Imported 3D models.
- Assigned materials to models 
- Coded in rotation and docking
- Added scripts to objects to path find and pursue
