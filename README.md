# Game Engines Resubmit

## Plan:
To make a space battle in which both sides of the battle both value their own lives while trying to take the others out and win.

To do this I created a field with a base on either side, then adding in boids to each side of the field that would wander in the general direction of each other until they were spotted. Then one would pursue the other until they got in close enough range to start firing upon them. When this happens one of them would turn back towards the safety of their own base. When they arrive there they start gaining health back up until they're at full and start to head back into the frey again.
To stop the persuing ship from waiting it senses danger from the base and heads back into the battlefield. This battle continues until one side is defeated, the ships are tied to the battlefield by a point in the center so that if they head too far out they get turned around to head back into the middle.

## Features I want:
- Wandering (noise)
- Pursue
- Flee
- Arrive
- Attack
- Realistic movement
- Preserve their own health

## Progress:
- Created the base project.
- Imported 3D models.
- Coded in behaviours 
- Coded in realistic movement
- Added in statistics to boids
